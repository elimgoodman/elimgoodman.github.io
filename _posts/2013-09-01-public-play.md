I woke up this morning thinking about arcades. Just to lay it out there - I was never a big arcade person. I grew after they had peaked. So my ideas about arcades aren't really informed by what they were like during their [Golden Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games). I'm actually much more interested in arcades as a possible [third place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). 

After World War II, a lot of people [^6] fled cities for the suburbs. A lot of the cities that experienced this exodus kind of collapsed. Furthermore, people had new kinds of problems to contend with out in the suburbs: notably, an increased sense of isolation. It seems like video games experienced something similar - what was once a communal and social activity retreated into geographic isolation (from the arcade to the home), arcades collapsed, and (console and PC) video games became their own sort of suburb - more adaptable to an individual's preferences, but more isolating.

Technological improvements have made both situations better, but certainly haven't made everything perfect. Skype and FaceTime make living far away from your family easier to deal with; Game Center and Steam make gaming feel like more a group activity. However, just as nothing compares to the novelty and spontaneity of city life, the same can be said for the arcade experience. The exposure to new games and new people made the experience richer [^7].

The idea of the third place is interesting, then, in light of this problem. Technology can't fully bridge the gap we feel when we're isolated, so we eventually have to get together somewhere with other people. I think the arcade could be this place - both for people who simply . But first, a digression about casinos. 

Last summer, I had to go to Las Vegas for a wedding. It was the first time I'd been to Vegas as an adult, and it was completely mind-boggling. [^1] Obviously, one of the biggest draws of Las Vegas are the casinos. If you've never been, let me tell you: the casinos are cavernous, expansive [^2], loud (visually and auditorially), [^3], saturated with the smell of old cigarette smoke, over air-conditioned [^4], and generally pretty horrible all around [^5]. This was a bummer to me, because I think the casino did 

Video games

- gambling
- the suburbanization of people made the third place more appealing; the suburbanization of videogames makes an arcade more appealing
- social gaming
- casual gaming
- mobile gaming

[^1]: Las Vegas (and why it is so mind-boggling to me) is a topic so sprawling that I won't attempt to address any of it in this post.
[^2]: I remember walking for 20 straight minutes through uninterrupted casino real-estate at some hotel or another.
[^3]: OK, also - my recollections of Las Vegas as a whole are also a bit foggy because it is a great place to be drunk. In fact (and I know I said I wasn't going to touch on the sprawling topic of Las Vegas but oh well), I would actually say that Las Vegas is *the best* place to be drunk in America. The whole edifice is designed to appeal to a completely wasted person - the inflated sense of self-importance, the hedonistic overstimulation, the complete absense of unpredictable danger (and abundance of manufactured "danger"), etc. I spent a lot of time drunk in  Las Vegas because it simply didn't make sense while sober. Drinking while in Las Vegas makes the whole thing snap into alignment, like the moment when you see the [sail boat in the Magic Eye poster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_f8ayQQx4I).
[^4]: A topic for another post - the fuck is up with air conditioning in America? Is 63 degrees really a temperature that feels good to most people?
[^5]: And I'm not even going to get into the patrons who populate the casinos, because a) as a topic it's way too depressing and b) I don't want to snark on other people.
[^6]: Well, white people.
[^7]: Detroit.
[^8]: Additionally, arcades offered a level of tactile novelty that's hard to create at home. The variety of interfaces and form factors in arcade games also gave them a depth of experience that was very cool.
