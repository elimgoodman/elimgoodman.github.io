I woke up this morning thinking about arcades. Just to lay it out there - I was never a big arcade person. I grew after they had peaked. So my ideas about arcades aren't really informed by what they were like during their Golden Age. I'm actually much more interested in arcades as a possible [third place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). 

Last summer, I had to go to Las Vegas for a wedding. It was the first I'd been to Vegas as an adult, and it was completely mind-boggling. [^1]

- gambling
- the suburbanization of people made the third place more appealing; the suburbanization of videogames makes an arcade more appealing
- social gaming
- casual gaming
- mobile gaming
