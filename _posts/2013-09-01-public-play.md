I woke up this morning thinking about arcades. Just to lay it out there - I was never a big arcade person. I grew after they had peaked. So my ideas about arcades aren't really informed by what they were like during their [Golden Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games). I'm actually much more interested in arcades as a new kind of [third place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place), one that incorporates what we've learned about game design in the past decade. I want to use this post as a way to think about what the arcade of the future could look like.

###Third Places

After World War II, a lot of people [^6] fled cities for the suburbs. Many of the cities that experienced this exodus kind of collapsed. Furthermore, those who fled had new kinds of problems to contend with out in the suburbs: notably, an increased sense of isolation. It seems like video games experienced something similar - what was once a communal and social activity retreated into geographic isolation (from the arcade to the home), arcades collapsed, and (console and PC) video games became their own sort of suburb - more adaptable to an individual's preferences, but more isolating.

Technological improvements have made both situations better. Skype and FaceTime make living far away from your family easier to deal with; Game Center and Steam make gaming feel like more a group activity. However, just as nothing compares to the novelty and spontaneity of city life, the same can be said for the arcade experience. The exposure to new games and new people made the experience richer [^7].

The idea of the third place is interesting, then, in light of this problem. Technology can't fully bridge the gap we feel when we're isolated, so we eventually have to get together somewhere with other people. I think the arcade could be this place - both for people who enjoy video games, and people who suffer from regular human loneliness. 

The good news is that I think that the overlap between these two groups is growing. And the bigger the overlap is, the more people would be served by a really good arcade. I think that this overlap is growing due to three big interrelated trends in video games: casual games, social games, and mobile games. An arcade that incorporate the insights from these three trends would have the potential to be really popular (and really fun, too).

###Casual Games


[^6]: Well, [white people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight).
[^7]: Additionally, arcades offered a level of tactile novelty that's hard to create at home. The variety of interfaces and form factors in arcade games also gave them a depth of experience that was very cool.
