**TL;DR:**. I'm interested in arcades as a new kind of [third place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place), one that incorporates what we've learned about game design in the past decade. I want to use this post as a way to think about what the arcade of the future could look like>

###Third Places

After World War II, a lot of people [^6] fled cities for the suburbs. Many of the cities that experienced this exodus kind of collapsed. Furthermore, those who fled had new kinds of problems to contend with out in the suburbs: notably, an increased sense of isolation. It seems like video games experienced something similar - what was once a communal and social activity retreated into geographic isolation (from the arcade to the home), arcades collapsed, and (console and PC) video games became their own sort of suburb - more adaptable to an individual's preferences, but more isolating.

Technological improvements have made both situations better. Skype and FaceTime make living far away from your family easier to deal with; Game Center and Steam make gaming feel like more a group activity. However, just as nothing compares to the novelty and spontaneity of city life, the same can be said for the arcade experience. The exposure to new games and new people made the experience richer [^7].

The idea of the third place is interesting, then, in light of this problem. Technology can't fully bridge the gap we feel when we're isolated, so we eventually have to get together somewhere with other people. I think the arcade could be this place - both for people who enjoy video games, and people who suffer from regular human loneliness. 

The good news is that I think that the overlap between these two groups is growing. And the bigger the overlap is, the more people would be served by a really good arcade. This overlap is growing due to the ever-expanding popularity of casual games, which I'll separate into mobile games and social games. An arcade that incorporate the insights from those two disciplines would have the potential to be really popular (and really fun, too).

###Mobile Games
Previously, if you wanted to enjoy some sort of video game while on the subway or wherever, you had to go out and buy a Gameboy, and some physical cartridges, and then take all that stuff with you in your bag. Basically, it took some real desire and commitment to get into that world. Mobile games make that all moot - you already own the game player, games are easy and cheap to acquire, and you don't have to think about bringing it with you when you go out.

What follows from that is if your game player and collection are with you all the time, you suddenly have ample opportunities to get *really good* at the games you like. The doctor's waiting room, the bus, the boring lecture - all of that otherwise idle time becomes an opportunity to hone your skills [^8].

These factors (coupled with the ridiculous popularity of mobile games in general) lead to an interesting phenomenon: **being really good at video games is no longer weird**. Lots of people play them; they play them all the time; and eventually, they become awesome at them. There's less of a difference between a "video game person" and a regular person.

###Social Games
Online sociality has been a part of "hardcore" gaming for a long time - clans, factions, and tournament ladders make up the fabric of many people's gaming experience. The big differences with modern social games is that they're largely collaborative, and they're focussed on connecting you with people you already know. Both of these factors mean that playing games with others is a way less intimidating experience.

Whereas mobile games have made being very good at video games a little more acceptable, social games have made the notion of collaborative digital play a totally mainstream thing for a group of people who were *incredibly* far from the old video game demographic sweet spot. Or to say it another way: **playing video games with other people is no longer weird.**

###The Arcade of the Future


[^6]: Well, [white people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight).
[^7]: Additionally, arcades offered a level of tactile novelty that's hard to create at home. The variety of interfaces and form factors in arcade games also gave them a depth of experience that was very cool.
[^8]: Don't get me wrong - I am *definitely* not saying that this is a good thing. I'm just saying that this is what I see happening.
