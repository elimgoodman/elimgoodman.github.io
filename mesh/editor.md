#The Structure Editor

* Start out with an extremely uniform representation 
* Primitives have default display and input methods
* Show editing a field, adding a new element to a list
* How do non-primitive values (ie references to other concept instances) end up inside of instances? Like, if I have something that takes a Fn, can I provide it with an expression that dynamically fetches a fn?
* Create customizations based on the type of the element, while retaining a level of uniformity that allows things to be reflowed and manipulated with a relatively consistent set of keyboard commands
