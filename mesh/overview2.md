#Overview

The design intention of Mesh is to combine the best features of modern IDEs (autocomplete, integrated debugging, powerful refactoring tools) with the power, flexibility, and "user-hackability" of Emacs and Smalltalk. The end goal is to give proficient programmers the ability to craft *an environment* that will allow them to create and modify programs with greater efficiency, less risk, and less frustration than traditional text-based tools. 

#Overview

Mesh is a tool for creating computer programs. It can be thought of as both an IDE and a language together, 

- tracking down problems
- exploring unfamiliar codebases
- making large-scale changes
- keeping a large codebase in your head
- creating robust, type-safe declarative representations of a domain (arguable)
- composing programs from smaller pieces
- live feedback
	- what is this, really? why do I need this?
	- get assurance that what I'm doing is correct without wading in too deep
