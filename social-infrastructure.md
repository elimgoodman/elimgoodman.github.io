### Social Infrastructure

- [Palaces for the People](https://www.amazon.com/Palaces-People-Infrastructure-Inequality-Polarization-ebook/dp/B078GCD9H3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I13BIE3WCGGA&keywords=social+infrastructure&qid=1698346742&sprefix=social+infra%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-1): the book where I first encountered the term "social infrastructure". A good overview of the concept, with lots of examples of successes and failures. Generally, an impassioned plea to examine and invest in this aspect of society. I was convinced!
- [MMOs from the Inside Out](https://www.amazon.com/MMOs-Inside-Out-Massively-multiplayer-Role-playing/dp/1484217233/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2SECROPXSFZNE&keywords=mmos+from+the+inside+out&qid=1698346817&sprefix=mmos+from+t%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840): as a person who's generally pretty obsessed with games, there's a lot of overlap between building pro-social spaces generally and designing virtual spaces that encourage healthy play. This book is an absolute monster (I think it's like...900 pages?) but I found it incredibly fascinating. Written by the literal progenitor of the form, it's a kitchen sink of a book: it veers between historical anecdotes, game design rants, psychological work-ups of the human race, a digression into mysticism and the hero's journey (!) - it's got it all. And it's only the first of two volumes!
- [Values-Based Data Science and Design](https://vbsd.super.site/): Lots of good stuff in here. The purview is a bit wider than strictly just social infrastructure, but it's generally great food for thought, and has some solid insights if you're willing to dig a bit.
- [Game-Design Patterns for Building Friendships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voz6S7ryWC0): A good and accessible talk in the same vein as the MMO book above. Designing digital play spaces / systems so that they actually help people build nourishing relationships.
- [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental-ebook/dp/B07J1T8P1W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GUN6MTHPX3SC&keywords=a+pattern+language&qid=1698348994&sprefix=a+pattern+lan%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1): a classic of the genre, but timeless. Another monster book - I admit, I haven't read it cover to cover, but even just bopping between appealing sections yields tons of insights and nuggets. True wisdom.
- [Communities of Play](https://www.amazon.com/Communities-Play-Emergent-Cultures-Multiplayer-ebook/dp/B08BSZRLDN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FF7JKPC4LERI&keywords=communities+of+play&qid=1698349152&sprefix=communities+of+play%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1): *Another* book on MMOs (I told you I was obsessed) - this one more of an ethnography about a very particular game / virtual world. Tons of lessons to glean - both around the construction of digital space, as well as the behavior of the human community formed within and around said space. A bit academic, but strangely compelling.
- [Meet Us By the Fountain](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uec8AwPAdTMf1nwWUnygb?si=f52e38dfffe24fa9): a 99% Invisible episode about shopping malls. A great examination about how they came to be and what's happened to them over time. There are some timeless truths in here about the hunger for connection, the need for environments that support that connection, and the forces that get in the way.
- I know that [Bowling Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Alone-Robert-D-Putnam-ebook/dp/B003DYGOO6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34TIWHANCPUDP&keywords=bowling+alone&qid=1698518929&sprefix=bowling+alone%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1) and [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities-ebook/dp/B01HWKSBDI/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2XU77GA2W7IX4&keywords=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities&qid=1698518944&sprefix=death+and+life%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1) should be on this list, but I haven't read them (yet).
