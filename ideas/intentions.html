<h1>Intentions</h1>

<div>
    I wrote these down as another way to help generate ideas. These are what I feel like I want software to help me accomplish in my life:
</div>

<ul id="inspirations" class="idea-list">
    <li>See the people I care about more</li>
    <li>Keep my relationship exciting</li>
    <li>Keep in touch with family</li>
    <li>Connect more meaningfully with my community</li>
    <li>Experience new and wonderful things</li>
    <li>Live more mindfully</li>
    <li>Become aware of my impact on the environment </li>
    <li>Create tools that are useful and have a positive impact</li>
    <li>Gain empathy for and understanding of people I don't know</li>
    <li>Produce creative works that are fulfilling for me and enjoyable for others</li>
</ul>
