## Social Infrastructure

- [Palaces for the People](https://www.amazon.com/Palaces-People-Infrastructure-Inequality-Polarization-ebook/dp/B078GCD9H3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I13BIE3WCGGA&keywords=social+infrastructure&qid=1698346742&sprefix=social+infra%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-1): the book where I first encountered the term "social infrastructure". A good overview of the concept, with lots of examples of successes and failures. Generally, an impassioned plea to examine and invest in this aspect of society. I was convinced!
- [MMOs from the Inside Out](https://www.amazon.com/MMOs-Inside-Out-Massively-multiplayer-Role-playing/dp/1484217233/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2SECROPXSFZNE&keywords=mmos+from+the+inside+out&qid=1698346817&sprefix=mmos+from+t%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840): as a person who's generally pretty obsessed with games, there's a lot of overlap between pro-social spaces generally and designing virtual spaces that encourage healthy play. This book is an absolute monster (I think it's like...900 pages?) but I found it incredibly fascinating. Written by the literal progenitor of the form, it's a kitchen sink of book: it veers between historical anecdotes, game design rants, psychological work-ups of the human race, a digression into mysticism and the hero's journey (!) - it's got it all. And it's only the first of two volumes!
- [Values-Based Data Science and Design](https://vbsd.super.site/): Lots of good stuff in here. The purview is a bit wider than strictly social infrastructure, but it's generally great food for thought, and has some good insights if you're willing to peruse.
- [Game-Design Patterns for Building Friendships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voz6S7ryWC0): A good and accessible talk in the same vein as the MMO book above. Designing digital play spaces / systems so that they actually help people build nourishing relationships.
- [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental-ebook/dp/B07J1T8P1W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GUN6MTHPX3SC&keywords=a+pattern+language&qid=1698348994&sprefix=a+pattern+lan%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1): a classic of the genre, but timeless. Another monster book - I admit, I haven't read it cover to cover, but even just bopping between appealing sections yields tons of insights and nuggets. True wisdom.
- [Communities of Play](https://www.amazon.com/Communities-Play-Emergent-Cultures-Multiplayer-ebook/dp/B08BSZRLDN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FF7JKPC4LERI&keywords=communities+of+play&qid=1698349152&sprefix=communities+of+play%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1): *Another* book on MMOs (I told you I was obsessed) - this one more of an ethnography about a very particular game / virtual world. Tons of lessons to glean - both around the construction of digital space, as well as the behavior of the human community formed within and around said space. A bit academic, but strangely compelling.
