    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p class="intro">
        <strong>Background:</strong> I had been in a long rut for awhile, very fixated on (read: obssesed with) a certain idea. The idea was too big, too broad, and quite bad. Nevertheless, I kept chewing on it. To get myself out of this mode, I decided to try generating 10 different ideas a day for 30 consecutive days, with the end goal of having 300 ideas after a month. I didn't even get close, but the exercise was really interesting and enjoyable nonetheless.

        <div>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Most of these ideas are <em>terrible</em>, or are already implemented. I didn't edit the list very strongly.
        </div>
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
        <strong>What I'm Thinking Of:</strong> The ideas I'm thinking of are all websites, apps, software libraries, projects, or potential businesses. For inspiration, I made a list of possible <a href="/ideas/inspirations.html">domains</a> that the ideas could fall into. Additionally, I also wrote down my <a href="/ideas/intentions.html">intentions</a> to help generate additional ideas.
    </p>

    <h3>The Ideas</h3>

    <ol class="idea-list">
        <li>A personal mobile diary app. You could record where you are (ie checkins), what you see (photos), what happened. However, it would be explicitly <em>not</em> social (ie, it's just for you). You would also own the data (as in, you could run the server on your machine, and the app would send the day's data back to wherever you specify). Additionally, I could see there being a web-based, OhLife-like component that emails you and asks for additional color on each day, and that allows you to augment each entry with additional information. It would be kinda like single-player Path, or Facebook Timeline. I also think it would be great if it had API integration with Twitter/Instagram/Foursquare, to pull in and archive data from these sites.
        <em>Update: <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> is totally this and I love it and use it.</em>
        </li>
        <li>A site for organizing/discovering YouTube covers of songs. Each song would have a page with links to different YouTube renditions (ranked by number of plays/likes/whatever), and also maybe links to tabs or sheet music, if you want to learn to play along.
        </li>
        <li>A Tumblr-esque site for building a personal books, movie, and music blog. It would be less about ratings and more about writing thoughtfully and at some length about each thing. Maybe saying why a certain piece was important in your life, or really delving into a review of the piece. Then, you would end up with a nice profile of all of your favorite things. There are definitely many things that are similar to this (most recently, the great app <a href="http://www.stamped.com">Stamped</a>), but nothing does <em>exactly</em> what I want.</li>
        <li>An app that allows you to subscribe to podcasts (ala the existing Apple Podcasts app), <em>but</em> which then allows you to mark certain episodes of a podcasts as your favorites, and follow friends. The upshot is that there could be a shuffle mode where you hear only the best episodes of different podcasts, suggested by your friends and other users. Podcasts with huge back catalogues can be daunting, and getting a good introduction to a show can be the difference between loving it and hating it.</li>
        <li>A website that helps real-life groups of friends decide what to do together. I was thinking that there could be an aspect that more or less mimicked <a href="http://www.doodle.com">Doodle</a>, but was then augmented with widgets to help the group decide on a movie to see or a restautant to eat at. Maybe more plan-oriented widgets could be added in the future, but I always find that my friend groups do one of those two things, and they're both a hassle to coordinate over email. I was also thinking that the composition of the group could be saved by the app, and it would show you the last time you hung out with various groups or people. Calendar integration could be another nicety.</li>
        <li>An app/website/organization that encouraged you to get rid of one thing from your house each week. You'd be encouraged to give it away, either to a stranger or charitable organization (rather than selling it). The goal here would be to tango with the hoarding urge, and to focus on which stuff is really important. There could be a community aspect, where people give things to each other (ala <a href="http://www.freecycle.org">Freecycle</a>). I could also see there being a ritual where you take a picture of each thing as you get rid of it, or maybe you give things to strangers, and talk with them, then document that experience and share it. Meet people, get rid of stuff, be simpler (and have an easier time when you need to move apartments!).</li>
        <li>I'm sure this exists (though, again, I couldn't find exactly what I had in mind): Goodreads for TV. Allow you to say which TV series you watch or have watched, and build up a "library". Foster good, meaningful conversation around television series. I'm thinking that this would target HBO-style high-quality TV series (not so much reality TV or things like Law and Order). There could also be a real-time commentary feature as new episodes aired, and then discussions of each episode after the fact.</li>
        <li>A site for book readers: you say the next three books that you're going to read, and it tries to place into ad-hoc book groups, based on your similarity with other users. Then, it picks a book you all have in common, and you read it together. The groups could be online/vitrual, or it could take geography into account and try and get you to meet for real. Often book clubs are hard because not everyone wants to read the same thing - this would solve that problem, and you would probably meet semi-compatible strangers as well.</li>
        <li>A simple service where you can pick out seasonal produce that you want, and someone gets that stuff from the farmer's market for you and delivers it to your house. There could probably be some way for vendors to communicate their inventory ahead of time. It would be pretty hard to scale, but I personally would love something like this.</li>
        <li>A webapp for hackathons. There could be a directory of hackathons happening near you in the near future. You could have a profile with your skills and links to past projects (or your Github/Dribbble/etc). Then, before the hackathon starts, you could look for people with complimentary skills (or just people who looked cool) and form a team. You could use the platform to brainstorm ahead of time and build enthusiasm. Then, after the hackathon is over, all of the projects could be linked to from the main event page, so you could look at everyone's work, and keep in touch with other people if you dug what they did.</li>
        <li>A place to post doodles. No following, no real names, no comments. Just a mobile app to snap pictures of weird doodles as you make them. It should be more or less anonymous. I think it'd be great to see a stream of people's weird little squiggles.</li>
        <li>A non-linear blog. It would be less focussed on coherent "posts" and more on disconnecting thoughts. The author could specify how the thoughts connected to one another, and the reader could navigate the thoughts with a graph-like interface. The landing page could have links to the newest thoughts, so you wouldn't have to traverse the depths of the graph to find the new stuff.</li>
        <li>A site for exploring cutting-edge science, created Wikipedia-style. There could be topic pages, and links to new research, news articles, studies, and so forth. The goal would less comprehensivess (as it is currently on Wikipedia), and more on making things accessible to lay people. I think there should also be an emphasis on discussion - not so much debate as an environment of honest inquiry and response. I would want people to feel comfortable asking for clarification around things they didn't understand. Lots of great science is happening around the world, all the time, and I don't know about any of it, and I wouldn't be able to understand even if I was aware. This might help that.</li>
        <li>"What's the story with..." news aggregator. Again, something created Wikipedia-style. This time, the emphasis is on timeliness and concision. Basically, what happens is I'll see allusions in the news to something (ie, the Greek economy). I want a site where I can say, "What's the story with the Greek economy?" and I'll get a one-paragraph summary of the situation, with links to articles explaining more. I would also appreciate summaries of different groups' perspectives (ie, if there's a liberal and conservative opinion), not to encourage debate, but to show different sides of the issue.</li>
        <li>A site to manage which gift cards you have in your possession, and then sell them for cash if you want to. I know the second part exists, but I'm not sure about the first. It must, right? I have so many frickin' gift cards lying around, and I always forget to use them.</li>
        <li>An app that makes it easy to schedule your day when you have a kid/kids. You could block out time for meals, naps, outings, and activities. What would be cool is if you could connect with other parents you knew. Then, you could see that they were going to the park from 2-3, say, and you could coordinate. You could also see in general what activities parents in the area were doing. You might not know about the story reading at the bookstore down the block, but if other parents are doing it, you could discover it. It would also be interesting if the parent could make the schedule, but the nanny would actually be the one bringing the child through the day. The nanny could "check in" to different items on the schedule, and maybe take pictures along the way. Then, even though the parent couldn't be there with the child, they'd get a small, vicarious taste of what the child is up to all day.</li>
        <li>A site where people can record their human role models and inspirations. For each "inspirer", have a profile page, with links to books, lectures, videos, essays, and quotes. If the person is still alive and tech-savvy, maybe they could come and "claim" their profile. They could then use it to communicate with people who admire them. At the very least, just having a place where I could list out the people who inspire me woudl be very gratifying - something I'd put effort into maintaining, and a great resource to tap into when I'm feeling depleted. Also, being able to easily discover amazing people (with access to their work) would be genuinely interesting. </li>
        <li>A site for people who have trouble decorating. Users could post pictures of the rooms/spaces they were struggling with, and other users could post tips, inspriational pictures, or actual products. I could see there being some kind of affiliate program, for when the querent actually purchases one of the suggested products.</li>
        <li>A lightweight, mobile, social music-making app. The app has a few instruments in it, drum machine, bass synth, and lead synth, say. You could connect with your friends (or strangers) and form a temporary "band". Then, each person could lead off by making a drum beat. After everyone is done, you "trade", and everyone receives someone else's beat, on top of which they would record a bassline. At the end, you end up with three little songs/loops, each of which was built collaboratively. I think it would be really fun to tap out little tunes while on the subway, and building something with your friends is always fulfilling. It would also be really cool to share the little tunes that you make.</li>
        <li>A comprehensive guide to all of the studio art exhibits happening in NYC. There could be pictures from people who had attended the exhibitions, and information about the artists being shown. However, there would expliciyly be <em>no</em> reviews.</li>
        <li>A dotfiles manager. It would use git/Github as a backend, and would have some awareness of which programs it contained dotfiles for. If this utility was installed, it would be one command to get all of your dotfiles set up on a new machine. Something that I think would also be cool is it other people were also using this utility (or at least conforming to the way it structured the files), then you would be able to "try out" someone else's dotfiles, to see how they were different, and to see if there was anything you wanted to steal from them.</li>
        <li>"Who do you use?" A place for people to say which doctors/handymen/cleaning people/plumbers/etc they use. There are so many emails at work that are like "can anyone recommend a good general dentist in Park Slope?" If there was a place where you could see which servicepeople your friends used, the problem would be much easier to solve. This also seems like something that probably exists already - if it does, I'd use it.</li>
        <li>A program that makes it easy to know how long it's been since you last say your friends. When you hang out with them, you make a note of it. Maybe it would also proactively email you if you hadn't seen them in a little while. I think this would be very simple, but I would use the hell out of it.</li>
        <li>A really simple tool to sync arbitrary, typed bits of data between your laptop and your phone. For example, if you're heading to a restaurant, you could add the address to the queue, and it would show up on your phone. You could also give it type information (ie, "this piece of data is an address"), and then your phone would do the right thing when you went to interact with that piece of data. You can do this now with something like <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a>, but it's inconvenient enough that I think another tool would be useful.</li>
        <li>A tool to help you keep in touch with a group of friends. You form a group and set an update interval ("every 2 months", say). At each interval, the program emails the group, asking for an update. Each group also gets a page, where the members can post smaller updates between intervals, and pictures and stuff.</li>
        <li>A site for (probably programming) conferences. Each conference would get its own page, with itineraries and links to the speakers. Each event would also get a page, where livetweets could be aggregated (maybe each even could get its own unique hashtag), along with links to the transcript, video, and slide deck (once the event was over). It would be cool to just browse all of the conferences that were happening, and also to look for conferences at which a specific person was speaking (ie, I'd love to see all of the conferences where Rich Hickey is going to speak).</li>
        <li>A generalized stream publishing/subscription/aggregation platform. Whereas w/a Tweet, the "payload" is just text (140 characters of text, to be exact), with this platform, the payload would be structured data (as JSON). So you could have different domain-specific post types. Sports scores, weather and traffic updates, news, stock movement, etc etc. There would be a centralized repository of canonical post types (each of which would be forkable) and a repository of display patterns for each post type (also forkable). I'm imagining this as a distributed, strongly-typed Twitter. I would imagine it used in constrained environments/domains, rather than a full-blown social network.</li>
        <li>A service that turns the unread items in your Instapaper queue into a physical, glossy magazine each month. Almost certainly illegal, but I would use the hell out of it.</li>
        <li>Site for organizing photo walks. Plan the route, invite people, and then share the walk (with everyone's photos charted along the route).</li>
        <li>A massively multiplayer online mobile game, wherein there are different levels of hierarchy. People at the top of the hierarchy are dependant on the the actions of people lower down in the hierarchy. For example, it could be that when you start out, you're just "mining" for credits (by doing some sort of puzzles, or whatever). However, these credits are used by people further up the ladder to do other tasks. There could be a few big teams, all competing against one another. I think it would be cool to have a sense of helping out other people on your team by doing the task set in front of you. It would also be cool to advance up the hierarchy, and essentially be playing a different game at each level, with the knowledge that when it gets easier, it's because the people beneath you are doing better.</li>
        <li>A web-based frontend for IRC. The client could have distinct configurations for each room, so each room could be laid out differently. You would be able to embed graphs, charts, logging panels, links, and other interface widgets into the display of each individual room. There's often a lot of other information that accompanies a conversation in IRC (while at work), so it would be cool to have a lot of control over the interface so as to bring relevant information into the picture, and have it be seen by everyone.</li>
        <li>Strongly-typed JSON. It would be just like JSON, but each field would also get a type annotation (it would probably even be possible to make it compatible with JSON, which would probably be a good idea). The types themselves would be defined in a type repository - there would probably be a canonical one, or you could run your own. Types would be forkable (which would be sort of like inheriting/cloning its prototype). I have no idea if this would be useful to anyone but me, but I always end up wanting it in my personal projects.</li>
        <li>An extension mechanism for email. I'm thinking that this would work over vanilla POP/IMAP/SMTP, but it would almost certainly need a custom webmail client to make it make sense. Basically, the system would allow the user to install "apps" for their email account. Apps would do two things: expose parsers/aggregators for email, and provide new embeddable data types. Parsers/aggregators would comb through all incoming messages, and try to parse and aggregate them according to a specification. This would allow for things like <a href="https://www.tripit.com/">Tripit</a>. You could use apps that would extract information about show tickets, plans, and whatever else, just from parsing the plain text of the message. As for embedding, the actual embedded content would simply be attatched to the message as JSON, with a special MIME type. So, it would be possible to include things like tasks, plans an outing, photosets, music files, and so on, directly in a message. If the recipient was using the special webmail client, they would see the content inline in the message. If not, there's a pretty straightforward to have these things degrade gracefully. The upshot is that with the combination of parser/aggregators and embedding, you could, for example, do all of your bug tracking using only email: the bugs themselves would be embedded directly in messages, and the aggregators could be pulling out the bug data and emitting it to be used in custom views in the webmail client (ie, "show me all messages assigned to me"). I don't think this is actually as daunting as it sounds (though still quite a huge endeavor).</li>
        <li>"Dating" for couples - just a way to meet other couples for friendship. A lot of people I know in couples have expressed a desire for more couple friends. The site could be super simple - basically filter by geographic location, age, and maybe a few interests. The nice thing is that the bar is much lower than for actual dating. People don't have to be nearly as compatible, and there's way less pressure.</li>
        <li>A date aggregator/suggester. Users could enter stuff like "We went to bar A, restaurant B, comedy club C", along with pictures and descriptions of each point along the way. It's a fun thing to share/brag about (great dates feel awesome to plan!). If a certain date looks good, you could mark it, and it would sync to your phone. There's also a nice opprotunity to help schedule things out for the evening, and to help with reservations/ticket buying. It might be nice to follow other great date-makers, and maybe even push people into doing double dates (if they have the same taste in dates).</li>
        <li>A very simple app: "when was the last time I...?" When was the last time I called my mom? Cleaned the bathroom? Changed my contacts? I don't know, but I <em>want</em> to know (and in the case of my contacts, actually need to know!)</li>
        <li>A script/framework that would operate as a generic version of Rails' generators. I'm always making new Flask projects (for small ideas that I have), and I have to do the same stupid steps each time (make a template directory, download jQuery, etc). It seems like kind of overkill to write a script that <em>just</em> does that. There are also times as work when I have to do a certain convoluted workflow (create file A, create file B, update file C), where something like a Rails generator would really do the trick. So make an easy way to create language agnostic generators. This seems tractable, but might be more trouble than it's worth.</li>
        <li>A way to view application logs in the browser. It would consist of two pieces: a server to stream logs to the browser, and a Javascript file that would be included client-side to create a log-viewing interface and start consuming the logs as they're streamed. Basically, this would just obfuscate the need to keep alt-tabbing to the terminal window to find the logs. You could also run the logs through grep first, and only have log viewer alert when a certain kind of alert happens. This actually has some cool potential. You could also parse the logs and send them over as JSON, which the log viewer could hydrate into an easier-to-examine format.</li>
        <li>A system to vote on second-run movies in theaters. Basically, what did you get to see that you didn't see when it was in theaters for the first time? In fact, this would probably work for current movies as well. There would be a few benefits: 1) get people invested in their local theater, 2) screen what people actually want to see, 3) work as market research for movie production companies. If lots of people of demographic X in market Y all say they want movie Z to play there, that could inform their marketing decisions. It would also be fun to have a thing where you could associate yourself to a theater, watch tons of trailers, and say "I want that at my theater."</li>
        <li>A better way to find room mates. Right now, I'm involved in a lot of "hey, I have an extra room" stuff on Facebook, but that seems like the (really crumby) state of the art. Basically, AirBNB, but for friends (and friends-of-friends) for long-term occupany only.</li>
        <li>A store that sells fresh, pre-assembled picnic baskets. You call ahead, say the number of people, and you get a basket with a main course, sides, beverages, travel utensils, and a nice blanket. You probably have to return the blanket, basket, and utensils at some later date.</li>
        <li>A site for oral tradition. People would tell stories, record them using a microphone, and post them. Old folks, new folks, old stories, new stories, drinking stories, weird stories, ghost stories, sad stories, love stories. Follow great storytellers.</li>
        <li>A program done through a grocery store. You pay a small monthly fee to participate. Then, if you're going to cook on a certain day, you let the store know. During the day, the store chooses a recipe (one that can be cooked in ~30 minutes) and assembles all of the ingredients. Then, you swing by the store on your way home from work, pick up the bag, get billed automatically for the cost of the ingredients (they keep your credit card on file), bring it home, and cook it up. No deciding what to make or hunting for ingredients.</li>
        <li>A subscription day-trip service. From April through November, on the first Sunday of each month, a bus comes to pick you up and you go somewhere interesting. Everything's taken care of. The same people come each time, so you can form relationships with them. Low stress, novel, social, and surprising. </li>
        <li>BreakBot - a simple IRC bot that digests a group's calendars, suggests group breaks/walks, and then messages people individually about personal breaks at regular intervals.</li>
        <li>An iPad-based menu for restaurants. Cover the iPad in a protective film, get detailed info on each item (ingredient info, allergen deets, etc), maybe even customer reviews. Not very sexy, but might work for something like a diner, which is more of a "utilitarian" restaurant.</li>
        <li>A simple system for setting up "watch words" on Craigslist - get a daily email digest of listings that match a given phrase.</li>
        <li>A non-profit service that collects back issues of magazines and distributes them. Or a weird service where you pay half of the subscription fee for a magazine to get each issue one interval late (ie get the New York a week late, Wired a month late). Second-run magazines! Plus, reduces waste.</li>
        <li>A digital prescription format. Doctor writes up a prescription, an app scans a QR code on the screen, then the pharmacist scans the QR code on the app. Hell - why doesn't the script just live in some online DB, that pharmacies can access? I'm sure there's tons of regulatory stuff that goes along with this, but the way we do prescriptions seems a bit backwards.</li>
        <li>A service that organizes "professional retreats" for people who can work remotely. They pick a nice location with fast internet, good food, and nice views. People go up, work during the day, then socialize and chill at night in the nature.</li>
        <li>A non-profit dedicated to "liberating" datasets from state and local governments.</li>
        <li>A site for people to share which beauty products they use, why, and if they like them. Get more info on sourcing and ingredient information for products.</li>
        <li>A "Skype box" for older people: a single-purpose device, with a nice camera and speakers, and a touch screen with different faces on it. Touch a face, talk to that person. Easy!</li>
        <li>An app for identifying stuff in the forest - bugs, trees, plants, and animal tracks.</li>
        <li>A site for finding running groups: on-the-fly meetups, just for jogging. Post the start time, route, and pace, and people can join in if they want to.</li>
        <li>A service for guided bike tours or excursions. Show up at a location on your bike and have a pre-planned day trip (and maybe learn some interesting stuff about the city to boot).</li>
        <li>An app for teens to voluntarily share their location with their parents, to check in with them. It wouldn't be stalking - the child would have to volunarily hit "share." A way for parents to get assurance about the kid without having to send texts or anything ("just check in with me when you get there.")</li>
        <li>Pop-up video/Soundcloud-style comments for classical music. Maybe have video as well as audio - watch the conductor conduct. Real-time insights about the piece - maybe even snippets of the sheet music. Have introductory lectures to each piece as well. Help regular people understand and enjoy classical music.</li>
        <li>A site to find live TV playing in bars. Bars have an incentive to list what's playing, as more people will show up. Maybe people could also say what they <em>want</em> to watch in a bar (ie football game A vs football game B), and bars could choose to show it, and it would notify everyone who wanted that program.</li>
    </ol>
